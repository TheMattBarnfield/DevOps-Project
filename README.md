# DevOps Apprenticeship: Project Exercise

## Getting started

The project uses a virtual environment to isolate package dependencies. To create the virtual environment and install required packages, run the following from a bash shell terminal:

### Requirements

*Poetry
*Python
*A mongo DB

### Installing dependencies
```bash
$ poetry install
```

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill it in with the correct values.

### Run the app

#### With Docker

Run either of these from the project root:

##### Local dev

The following command will work in WSL. If you are using a different shell you'll need to replace `"$(wslpath -w $(pwd))"`
with the absolute path to the project root.

```bash
docker build --target dev --tag todo-app:dev .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v "$(wslpath -w $(pwd))":/app todo-app:dev
```

##### Prod
```bash
docker build --target prod --tag todo-app:prod .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env todo-app:prod
```

#### Manually

Once the setup script has completed and all packages have been installed, start the Flask app by running:
```bash
$ poetry run flask run
```

You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with fsevents reloader
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 226-556-590
```
Now visit [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/) in your web browser to view the app.

## Tests

For the end-to-end tests, you'll need to install firefox and Gecko Driver.

Run the tests with the command:
```poetry run pytest tests/<unit|integration|e2e>```

You can also run them with docker using:

```
docker build --target all_tests -t todo-app:tests .
docker run --name todo-app-test --env-file .env todo-app:tests
```

## CI

This CI for this project can be found here: https://travis-ci.com/github/TheMattBarnfield/DevOps-Project.
It automatically runs the tests whenever a pull request is raised.
